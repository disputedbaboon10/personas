  <h2 style="margin-top: 4rem">What makes a successful interface?</h2>
  <text1>Interfaces are everywhere and are used for a wide variety of tasks. A succseful interface is one that intuitivly gives users the ability to frictionlessly access functionality.
    To better understand how to design a successful interface, I am going to be studying and observing a water and ice dispenser.
    In watching people use this machine and asking them about their experience, I hope to answer the question: <strong>is this a good interface?</strong>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 6rem">How to interact with this interface?</h2>
    <text1>Although many succesful interfaces don't require an instruction manual, it isn't trivial how to use this interface from the sketch (depicted at right); therefore, I will list out its functionality below.</text1>
    <ul>
      <li>The interactive portion of the interface is 5 capacative touch buttons and two physical buttons that are pressed using the cup.</li>
      <li>The "Freezer Temp" & "Refrigerator Temp" capacative touch buttons change the freezer or refrigerator tempurature. The current tempurature corresponds to the indicator bars above the respective button.</li>
      <li>The "Light" capacative touch button turns on a light that illuminates the shelf for the cup.</li>
      <li>The "Ice Type" capacative touch button toggles the ice shape between cubed and crushed ice. The current ice type corresponds to the shape of ice in the cup above the "Ice Type" button.</li>
      <li>The "Lock" capacative touch button toggles the dispenser between locked and unlocked. When locked, no water or ice is dispensed.</li>
      <li>To get water in your cup, you must place your cup in front of the water indicator button and press into the dispenser using your cup.</li>
      <li>To get ice, you must place your cup in front of the ice cubes under the dispenser and press into the dispenser using your cup.</li>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Q & A</h2>
    <text><strong>Q1: Where do you put your cup to get water?</strong></text>
    
    <ul>
      <li>First-time users will often place their cup under the ice machine and press the water button (which then spills onto their hand</li>
      <li>Returning users often know to use the cup to press the water</li>
    </ul>
    <text><strong>Q2: Where do you put your cup to get ice?</strong></text>
    <ul>
      <li>Most individuals understand that pushing the cup into the ice button dispenses ice into the cup</li>
      <li>Some individuals place the cup down, look for a button, and then realize they need to push the cup in further</li>
    </ul>
    <text><strong>Q3: Where do you press to change the ice type? How do you know the ice-type is now correct?</strong></text>
    <ul>
      <li>First-time users often don't understand that the ice shape varies nor do they understand that the current ice shape is denoted by the shapes indicated in the cup above the button</li>
      <li>Returning users understand that if they want a specific ice shape they can look at the indicator and toggle the "Ice Type" button if necessary</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="normal_container">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">OBSERVATIONS</h2>
  
    <ul>
      <li>The biggest problem people face when using this interface is where to place the cup when they want ice vs. when they want water. This sometimes leaves a mess of ice and water on the floor! </li>
    </ul>
    <ul><li>Sometimes users will place their cup in the ice location and use their hand to press the water button.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Nobody understands the functionality or purpose of neither the lock (because it is easily unlocked) nor the filter (because there are not any physical filter changes).</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Because the buttons are pressure sensors and not physical buttons, the only way users know if a button press was successful is feedback from lightup icons.</li></ul>
    <ul>      <li>Although the interface is a bit tricky to learn, once the users understand the mechanisms involved, they successfully use the water/ice dispenser in the future.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>STORYBOARD</h2>
    <text>Storyboards help us walk through a potential users experience with an interface. Storyboards can help me understand what the faults of this interface are and how a user might encounter them. I have drawn out a storyboard of Ulma using this interface.
      Her goal is simply to get a cup of water.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 4rem">Was this interface successful?</h2>
    <text1>For returning users the interface was succesful because, more often than not, they recalled how to use the machine and knew how to get what they desired.
      For new users the interface was usually unnsuccesful because the interaction would often end up with a mess or an experienced user lending a helping hand.</text1>
